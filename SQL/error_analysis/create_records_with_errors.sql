/*
File: create_records_with_errors.sql

This SQL query creates a new table named 'records_with_errors'
by selecting rows from the 'user_data' table where columns 
have missing or empty values as well as those records where the 
'ride_length' are negative. The conditions ensure that any 
columns are checked for validity before being included in the 
new table.
