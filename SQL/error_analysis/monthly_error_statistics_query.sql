/*
File: monthly_error_statistics_query.sql

The "monthly_error_statistics_query.sql" script calculates
and summarizes error statistics on a monthly basis from 
the "user_data" table. It retrieves counts of records
with errors, where specific columns contain NULL values,
empty strings (''), or whitespace (' '), and calculates 
the corresponding percentage against total records for 
each month. The results include columns for the month, 
counts of errors in various columns, error percentages 
rounded to two decimal points, and are ordered 
chronologically. By executing this query, you can gain 
insights into the prevalence of errors within different 
months, aiding data quality assessment and pattern recognition.
