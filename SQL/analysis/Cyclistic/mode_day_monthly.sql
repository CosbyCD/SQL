/*
File: mode_day_monthly.sql

This query analyzes ride data for "Member" and "Casual" users, 
presenting the mode (most frequent) day of the week, total ride 
count, and average ride length in minutes for each month of the 
year. The query enables a comprehensive evaluation of user behavior
based on day-to-day patterns, allowing for meaningful insights into 
user preferences and engagement trends. By segmenting data by user 
type and highlighting mode days, the analysis contributes to a 
well-informed understanding of ride utilization patterns, aiding 
in data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for 
ride-sharing services. The output provides a clear breakdown of 
mode days across user types, fostering a better grasp of user 
engagement dynamics on a monthly basis.
