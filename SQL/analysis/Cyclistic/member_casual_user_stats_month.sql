/*
File: member_casual_user_stats_month.sql

This SQL query calculates and presents a breakdown of member 
and casual user counts, along with the percentage difference,
for each month of the year. Utilizing data from the "user_data" 
table, the query summarizes the counts of members and casual 
users and computes the percentage difference between these two 
groups. The results are presented in a formatted and organized 
manner, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of user patterns
over the months.
