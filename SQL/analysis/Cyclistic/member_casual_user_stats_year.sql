"This  query conducts an analysis of bike-sharing data
from the 'user_data' table, specifically focusing on 
the total counts of members and casual riders for the year,
along with the percentage difference between these counts.
The query employs conditional aggregation techniques to 
achieve accurate calculations and utilizes rounding for 
result clarity. The analysis provides insights into rider 
distribution and trends for the specified year."
