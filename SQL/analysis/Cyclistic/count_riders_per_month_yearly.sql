/*
File: count_riders_per_month_yearly.sql

This SQL query employs the crosstab function to transform ride
count data from the user_data table. The query calculates 
and categorizes the number of rides undertaken by both member 
and casual riders for each month of the year. The pivot table 
generated from this query offers a concise summary, allowing 
analysis of monthly ride patterns and a comparison of ride counts
between member and casual riders. This information can be 
valuable for understanding rider engagement trends and making
informed decisions related to resource allocation and service 
enhancements.
