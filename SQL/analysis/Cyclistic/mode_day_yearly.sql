File: mode_day_yearly.sql

This SQL query offers a detailed exploration of ride length
trends for "Member" and "Casual" users throughout the year.
By analyzing the "user_data" dataset, it identifies the 
day of the week with the highest ride activity and computes 
the average ride duration in minutes for each user type on 
that particular day. The results are accompanied by the 
respective weekday, enabling a precise comparison of ride 
behaviors between user categories. This inquiry into the 
annual peak ridership day enhances the understanding of 
user engagement patterns and provides valuable insights 
for strategic planning and optimizing the overall user 
experience.
