/*
File: avg_ride_length_analysis_by_season.sql

This query adeptly segments ride data into distinct seasons (Spring, Summer,
Autumn, Winter) according to the "started_at" month. Subsequently, it calculates
the mean ride duration for both "member" and "casual" users within each seasonal
category, while also determining the percentage disparity between the two. The 
outcomes are organized by season and thoughtfully arranged in descending order 
based on the average ride duration for "casual" users, enabling a comprehensive 
understanding of usage patterns across different seasons.
