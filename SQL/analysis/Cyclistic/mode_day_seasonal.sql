File: mode_day_seasonal.sql

This query performs a comprehensive analysis of ride data based on 
the seasons, providing insights into user behavior and preferences. By 
categorizing rides into Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, and further 
segmenting by user type (Member or Casual), the query calculates the 
average ride length for each day of the week within each season and 
user type. The results highlight the mode day of the week for each 
season and user type combination, shedding light on patterns and 
preferences. The output is presented in a clear and organized manner,
allowing for easy identification of trends and variations in ride 
behaviors across different seasons and user types. This analysis 
contributes to a deeper understanding of user engagement and usage 
patterns, aiding decision-making for targeted marketing efforts 
and service improvements.
