/*
File: max_ride_length_analysis_seasonal.sql

This SQL query offers a comprehensive analysis of ride length
statistics for "Member" and "Casual" users, segregated by 
distinct seasons throughout the year. By categorizing rides
into Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the query presents
total and maximum ride lengths in hours, minutes, and seconds.
The values are normalized by user counts, ensuring equitable 
comparisons and eliminating bias from varying user populations. 
This approach provides impartial insights into ride length 
behaviors, enabling a nuanced understanding of user segments
and their interactions with the platform.
