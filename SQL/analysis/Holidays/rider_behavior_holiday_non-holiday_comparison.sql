/*
File: rider_behavior_holiday_non-holiday_comparison.sql

The query analyzes rider behavior by calculating the average
counts of casual and member riders on both holidays and 
non-holidays. It achieves this by categorizing each day based
on the presence of a holiday and then computing the respective
averages. The results provide insights into how rider patterns
differ between these two day types.
