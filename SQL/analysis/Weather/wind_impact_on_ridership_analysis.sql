File: wind_impact_on_ridership_analysis.sql

This query examines the relationship between wind speed and ridership behavior
by categorizing wind speed into ranges. It calculates the count of casual and
 member riders for each wind speed range. The output provides insights into how
different wind speed levels influence ridership engagement.
