File: weather_impact_on_ridership_analysis.sql

The provided query analyzes the impact of temperature and 
precipitation on ridership patterns by categorizing the data
into temperature ranges and precipitation statuses. The query
calculates the count of casual and member riders for each 
combination of temperature range, precipitation status, 
and precipitation type. The output offers insights into 
how different weather conditions influence ridership, 
considering factors such as temperature and the presence 
of precipitation, including rain, snow, and ice. The results
allow for a comprehensive understanding of how these weather
variables affect rider behavior.
