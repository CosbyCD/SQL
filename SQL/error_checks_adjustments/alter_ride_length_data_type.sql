File: alter_ride_length_data_type.sql
Description:

The "alter_ride_length_lata_type.sql" serves to enhance the data 
integrity and analytical capabilities of the "user_data" table 
by modifying the data type of the "ride_length" column. By altering 
the column's data type to "NUMERIC," this operation ensures precise 
numerical representation for calculations and comparisons within the 
dataset.

Methodology:

The ALTER TABLE command, in conjunction with the ALTER COLUMN modifier, 
is employed to effect this change. The SET DATA TYPE clause specifies 
the target data type, which, in this case, is "NUMERIC." The USING 
clause further refines the process, employing the expression 
"ride_length::NUMERIC" to seamlessly convert the existing data in the 
"ride_length" column to the newly designated data type.

Impact and Advantages:

The transformation of the "ride_length" column to a "NUMERIC" data type 
equips the dataset with the necessary foundation for accurate 
mathematical operations and effective data analysis. The updated data 
type permits precise calculations and meaningful comparisons, vital for 
deriving insights, patterns, and trends from the "user_data" table. 
This alteration reinforces data integrity and positions the dataset for 
advanced quantitative exploration.

Upon successful execution of this SQL statement, the "ride_length" column 
in the "user_data" table will be imbued with the attributes of the 
"NUMERIC" data type, rendering it conducive to rigorous numerical analysis 
and contributing to the overall robustness of the dataset.
